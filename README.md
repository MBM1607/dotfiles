# .dotfiles
	Simple barebones dotfiles repository for tmux, bash, and git.

## Installation

I would not recommend using these dotfiles as they are pretty barebones and just for my personal use.

All you need to do is clone the repository in your home ~ directory inside the dotfiles folder.

``` git clone https://github.com/MBM1607/dotfiles ```

Then run the install script, it will take care of making symlinks of your dotfiles and it will also back up any old dotfiles inside dotfiles_old directory also in ~.

``` ./install.sh ```

This will alse clone the tmux package manager and run the tmux source command to effect any tmux shells currently running.

### Request

If you feel that I am doing a big mistake somewhere in these dotfiles, I probably am.
I am complete beginner so please send me feedback if you read this and also please don't use these.
